Password Manager Website
Overview
The Password Manager Website is a secure, user-friendly platform that allows users to store and manage their passwords in a centralized location. With this web application, users no longer need to remember multiple passwords for various accounts. Instead, they can access all their credentials from a single, encrypted vault with just one master password.

Features
Secure Storage: All passwords are stored using advanced encryption to ensure user data is kept safe and private.
Master Password Protection: Only the user knows their master password, which unlocks access to all stored credentials.
Password Generator: A built-in password generator helps users create strong, random passwords for enhanced security.
Cross-Platform Access: Access your password vault from any device with a web browser.
Organize Passwords: Store and categorize your passwords by type (e.g., social media, banking, work-related).
Auto-fill Integration (Optional): Browser extensions can be added for auto-filling login forms on various websites.
How It Works
Sign Up / Log In: Users create an account with a unique master password. This master password is required for accessing their vault and is never stored on the server.
Add Passwords: Users can add new passwords, each associated with a specific website, username, or service.
Password Encryption: Each password is encrypted before being stored, using the master password as the key for decryption.
Access Credentials: When needed, users can log in, view, copy, or auto-fill their credentials into websites.
Security
End-to-End Encryption: All data is encrypted on the client-side before being sent to the server, meaning the server never has access to plain text passwords.
Two-Factor Authentication (Optional): Enhance security by enabling two-factor authentication for an extra layer of protection.
Zero Knowledge Architecture: The platform follows a zero-knowledge protocol, meaning even the service provider cannot view your passwords.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or your preferred frameworks like React, Angular, etc.)
Backend: Node.js, Express (or your preferred backend framework)
Database: MongoDB, MySQL (or any secure database)
Encryption: AES-256 or any other encryption standard
